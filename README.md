# Kin Android SDK
====================================================================================
# THIS VERSION IS NOW DEPRECATED AND NO LONGER ACTIVELY MAINTAINED
## Please check out the Kin SDK for Android [here](https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-android)
## The `:base` module replaces what's here and provides additional functionality
## The `:base-compat` module is a drop in replacement for this older version of the SDK to aid in the transition
